# RiuCommunication
Repository for the riuCommunication project which would be a web page with news analysis from a left-wing, socially aware perspective. 

RiuCommunication will cover news relevant to the public of Latin America: Attacks against Latin America unification, corporations and agendas and their impact on the majority, public officials: their work and agenda, social causes their state, progress and support.


RiuCommunication will cover news that are relevant to the public. This should go without say, however, profit motive and owners agenda lead media to be a tool against the people, or be full of yellow journalism, smears and blatant lies. 

Meant to counter dominant traditional media on Latin America that pushes an imperialstic, corporate and classist agenda. 

RiuComunnication is meant to be a system to involve left-wing activist from around the globe.
